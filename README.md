#### Obsoleted ...

The site.conf in this repository is overwritten via gluon-config-mode-site-select-ffgt module (ffgt_packages-v2015.1 repo).

site.mk file is still being used though (but x86-images are build differently, there's a patched Makefile in place that adds stuffe needed for the FSC Futros).
